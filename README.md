## 🧠 How It Works

- The AI chatbot parses user input using NLP and extracts intent (action, time, task, description)
- Events and tasks are stored in MongoDB and synced live to calendar or dashboard
- UI updates in real time using custom event listeners (`calendar-updated`)

## 🧪 Coming Soon

- Pomodoro-based Focus Mode  
- Google Calendar sync  
- AI-based task suggestions  
- Community Feed & Accountability Buddy System
